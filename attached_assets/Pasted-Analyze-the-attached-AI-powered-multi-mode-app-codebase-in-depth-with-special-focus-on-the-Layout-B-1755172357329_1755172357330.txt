Analyze the attached AI-powered multi-mode app codebase in depth, with special focus on the Layout Builder module. This is a React + TypeScript frontend with an Express backend, WebSocket-based real-time sync, and AI command execution for other sections like the Smart Canvas and Task Manager.

Current Problems in the Layout Builder module:

When switching to AI Mode in the Layout Builder and typing a command, the AI replies in chat but does not execute any actions on the UI. The AI-generated instructions are not being processed into actual layout updates.

Manual Mode allows creating a layout (name, columns, gap), but once created, the layout elements are static — clicking them or interacting with controls does nothing. No actual block addition, editing, or layout updates happen.

There is no dynamic linkage between AI commands and the layout rendering logic — unlike in other modules (e.g., Smart Canvas or Task Manager) where AI commands directly trigger functional UI updates.

What I want fixed:

Implement full functional behavior for the Layout Builder so that AI commands can create, edit, and remove layouts and blocks dynamically in real time.

Ensure AI Mode in the Layout Builder works like other modules: when a text or voice command is given, the AI interprets it and updates the UI without manual clicks.

Make the layout grid interactive: allow adding text/image blocks, containers, and widgets through both manual clicks and AI commands, with live rendering updates.

Ensure that block manipulation (drag, resize, delete) works, and changes persist in the backend or via WebSocket sync where applicable.

Maintain consistency with the existing architecture (hook-based state management, shadcn/ui components, and Groq AI integration).

Your tasks as the coding AI agent:

Trace through the Layout Builder code to identify where AI command results are not hooked into state update functions.

Implement the missing handlers so that AI-generated layout actions trigger the same code paths as manual layout edits.

Enable real-time UI updates for newly created or modified layouts and blocks.

Integrate voice command processing in Layout Builder, mirroring the logic from other AI-enabled modules.

Test the changes in both AI Mode and Manual Mode to confirm everything is functional and responsive.
