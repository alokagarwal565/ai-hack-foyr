Build an AI-Powered Traditional Application with Groq Integration
Build an AI-Powered Traditional Application that seamlessly integrates both manual UI interaction and intelligent agent control using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Create a dual-mode application where users can either interact directly through the interface or control it via AI agent commands through voice, chat, or prompt-based instructions.

Core Problem Statement
Develop a traditional application with a functional UI that can be controlled by an AI agent through MCP. The same functionality should be achievable through both manual user interaction and AI agent commands, demonstrating how classic tools can evolve into agent-friendly, AI-native experiences.

Recommended Application Ideas
1. Smart Shape Drawing Canvas

Manual Mode: Traditional drawing tools (rectangle, circle, line, move, delete, resize)

Agent Mode: Voice/text commands like:

"Draw three circles of radius 20 in a row"

"Create a rectangle 100x50 in the center"

"Delete all shapes and draw a house outline"

"Change all circles to red color"

2. Intelligent Task Management System

Manual Mode: Standard to-do list with add, edit, complete, delete, sort functions

Agent Mode: Natural language commands like:

"Mark all today's tasks as done"

"Add 'Review design mockups' with high priority"

"Show me tasks due this week"

"Create a morning routine checklist"

3. Dynamic Layout Grid Builder

Manual Mode: Drag-and-drop interface for adding/moving blocks, text boxes, images

Agent Mode: Layout commands such as:

"Add a 2-column layout with 3 text boxes and 1 image"

"Create a dashboard layout with sidebar and main content area"

"Rearrange blocks in a mobile-friendly stack"
